			<h4>Scope</h4>

				<b>Scope Overview</b><br>
					<p>
						Dr. Jawaharlal would like to create a smart and intelligent application to 
						efficiently track stock trades. This data will be used to identify patterns 
						which can help the client maximize profits through the analysis of brokerage data. 
						The application is expected to be used for personal use (initially), with the 
						potential of commercialization in the future. <br>
					</p><br>
				<b>Which parts of the business problem will be addressed?</b><br>
				<p>
					Dr. Jawaharlal is interested in the developement of a website to analyse stock trades. 
					The application will consolidate all processes and tools into one workable application 
					that will give the user the ability to help analyse historical data for increasing profitable 
					trades over time.
