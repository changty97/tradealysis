			<h4>Background</h4>

				Computer Science at California State University, Sacramento. He has more than 
				25 years of academic, industrial and entrepreneurial experience in engineering 
				and is renowned for his innovative, engaging teaching pedagogy. As someone who is 
				interested in stock trading Dr. Jawaharlal would like our team to create an application 
				that can help to optimally analyze short term stock trades. 
				<br> 
			</p>

				<h4>Scope</h4>
				<p>
					<h5>Scope Overview</h5>
						<p>
							Dr. Jawaharlal would like to create a smart and intelligent application to 
							efficiently track stock trades. This data will be used to identify patterns 
							which can help the client maximize profits through the analysis of brokerage data. 
							The application is expected to be used for personal use initially, with the 
							potential of commercialization in the future. <br>
						</p>
					<h5>Which parts of the business problem will be addressed?</h5>
					<p>
						Dr. Jawaharlal is interested in the developement of a website to analyse stock trades. 
						The application will consolidate all processes and tools into one workable application 
						that will give the user the ability to help analyse historical data for increasing profitable 
						trades over time.

				<h4>Highlights</h4>
				<p>This application is specifically designed for the purpose of pattern creation and trade analysis.</p>
				<p>
					Patterns can be created and modified to the userâ€™s preference based on criteria in the applications 
					spreadsheet columns. Additionally, a success rate for each pattern will be automatically generated 
					based on trade history. This further assists trade analysis for the purpose of increasing profits.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second key feature in our application is a Reports page which allows the user to sort trade 
					entries based on one or more column criteria. Trade data visualization is also updated in real-time. 
					Together, this allows for even more flexibility and customization
