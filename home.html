		<h3>Background</h3>
		<p> <!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
			Dr. Mariappan Jawaharlal is the Associate Dean of the College of Engineering and 
			Computer Science at California State University, Sacramento. He has more than 
			25 years of academic, industrial and entrepreneurial experience in engineering 
			and is renowned for his innovative, engaging teaching pedagogy. As a stock trader 
			interested in short term trading, Dr Jawaharlal would like our team to create an 
			application which can be used to optimize the time it takes to analyse trades. The 
			final application should consolidate all data preprocessed from brokerages so that 
			Dr. Jawaharlal does not have to switch between various instances of Excel or other
			websites/Applications.<br> 
		</p>

		<h3>Scope</h3>
		<p> <!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
			<b>Scope Overview</b><br>
				<p>
					Dr. Jawaharlal would like to create a smart (and possibly intelligent) application that can 
					help to efficiently track stock trades. This data will then be used to identify patterns 
					which can help the client consolidate all stock data into one workable application. The application 
					is expected to be used for personal use initially, with the potential commercialized this site for
					all stock traders interested in short term trading. <br>
				</p><br>
	
			<b>Which parts of the business problem will be addressed?</b><br>
			<p>
				Dr. Jawaharlal is interested in the developement of a website to analyse stock trades. 
				The application will consolidate all processes and tools into one workable application 
				that will give the user the ability to help analyse historical data for increasing profitable 
				trades over time. 
			</p><br>
			
			
			<b>What are the project goals?</b><br>
			<p>Implement Reports Page Based On Data Inserted to Site</p>
			<p>Implement Strategies Page, Set Parameters to Specific Strategies</p>
			<p>Analyse Stocks Inported Based on Strategies Defined Or Discovered</p>
